For the week4 lecture and practical, I leraned a lot about how to use git and github. It is a little bit hard and the practical includes lots of works to do, some of the introduction are not so clear and some of them need discussion and find out the problems occured. I faced different kinds of errors like at the start of the git it occurred errors and I find out I need to change the config and add my name and email so that it can push files successfully. I came acroos the error by communicating with each other and search the question online. I think I gained amounts of knowledge about the version control tool git and github which is very useful in the future programming. I have no extra questions.
